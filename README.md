# ContainerizationAPI

The general idea of this project is to provide a service similar to the [CodeExecutionAPI](https://github.com/thealcodingclub/CodeExecutionAPI) by [The Alcoding Club](https://github.com/thealcodingclub) but to manually implement the containerization using cgroups, namespaces, chroot and a bunch of other unix/linux utility tools. This will help accomplish faster execution times and cut down on sandboxing overhead

## Requirements

To use this API, there aren't really any requirements, you just need to be able to send HTTP requests
To **Host** this API, you need to have Linux or WSL (if you're on windows) or MacOS, because this project makes heavy use of unix-specific tools.

## Usage

Using this API is designed to be as simple as possible, at it's core, it's just an HTTP request that you send to `/v2/execute`, or `/execute`

The following are the routes that this API makes available, click one to see it's documentation

---
### POST Route: /execute
---
This route is a drop in replacement for [CodeExecutionAPI](https://github.com/thealcodingclub/CodeExecutionAPI), if you send any request to the API defined in that repository, it's actually going to be handled by this codebase (because it does the same exact thing but faster)

This route takes 4 fields:

| Parameter | What It Does | Default & Limits | How To Use |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| **language** | Specifies which programming language to execute your code in. The API needs to know which compiler/interpreter to use. | **Required** (no default)<br><br>**Supported values:**<br>• `python` - Python 3.x<br>• `cpp` - C++17 (G++)<br>• `c` - C11 (GCC)<br>• `java` - Java (OpenJDK) | Pass as a string. Must exactly match one of the supported values (all lowercase).<br><br>**Example:** `"language": "python"` |
| **code** | The actual source code you want to run. This is what gets executed in the isolated environment. | **Required** (no default)<br><br>**No explicit size limit** | Pass as a single string. Use `\n` for line breaks. Escape any quotes inside your code.<br><br>**Single line:** `"code": "print('Hello')"`<br><br>**Multi-line:** `"code": "def hello():\n    print('world')\nhello()"` |
| **timeout** | Maximum execution time. If your code runs longer than this, it gets killed immediately to prevent infinite loops or runaway processes. | **Default:** `5` seconds<br>**Max:** `60` seconds | Pass as an integer (seconds). Your code will be terminated the moment it exceeds this limit.<br><br>**On timeout:** Returns `"Execution Timed Out"` error with no output.<br><br>**Example:** `"timeout": 10` (runs for max 10 seconds) |
| **max_memory** | Maximum RAM your code can use. If your code allocates more memory than this, it gets killed to prevent memory exhaustion. | **Default:** `32768` KB (32 MB)<br>**Max:** `131072` KB (128 MB) | Pass as an integer (KB). Memory is monitored in real-time during execution.<br><br>**On limit exceeded:** Returns `"Memory limit exceeded"` error.<br><br>**Example:** `"max_memory": 65536` (allows up to 64 MB) |
| **inputs** | Provides STDIN data for programs that read user input. Each array element becomes one line of input, delivered in order as your code calls `input()`, `scanf()`, etc. | **Default:** `[]` (no input)<br><br>**No explicit size limit** | Pass as an array of strings. Each string is one line of input. Elements are consumed sequentially.<br><br>**Single input:** `"inputs": ["bob"]`<br><br>**Multiple inputs:** `"inputs": ["bob", "alice", "25"]`<br><br>Use this if your code reads from STDIN|

*Note: the above mentioned default and max values can be modified by editing the environment variables mentioned at the bottom of this README*

I'm making this as part of a bigger project to host my own coding contests on a platform a little better than HackerRank. The Alcoding Club's API is fine but I need one that's more efficient and has less overhead than firejail.

### Environment Variables

- `MAX_TIMEOUT`: This is the maximum timeout that a request can set, if an incoming request has a higher timeout than the value you set here, then it will ignore the request's set timeout only be executed for `MAX_TIMEOUT` time.
    - this env variable uses the **Go Duration String** format e.g - `1m30s`, `4h15s`, `5s`
    - if you dont set this env variable, it defaults to `60s`
    - the public version of this api has this value set to `60s`
- `MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT`: Maximum RAM allocation that a request can be set to, if an incoming request tries to set to a higher memory limit, it will be ignored and reset to this value
    - this must be set to an unsigned integer (positive number) and is measured in Kilobytes (KB)
    - if you dont set this env variable, it defaults to `131072` which is `128 MB` or `131072 KB`
    - the public version of this api has this value set to `131072`
- `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`: If an incoming request does not have a `timeout` parameter (i.e, request does not specify a time limit) then the sandbox will set the time limit to this value
    - same format as `MAX_TIMEOUT`
    - if you dont set this env variable, it defaults to `5s`
    - the public version of this api has this value set to `5s`
- `DEFAULT_MEMORY_LIMIT`: If an incoming request does not have a `max_memory` parameter (i.e, request does not specify a memory limit) then the sandbox will set the maximum memory limit to this value
    - same format as `MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT`
    - if you dont set this env variable, it defaults to `32 MB`
    - the public version of this api has this value set to `32 MB`
- `GLOBAL_RAM_LIMIT`: The total amount of RAM that is available globally to the server, cumulatively, the API will not allocate more RAM than what you define here, for example, if RAM limit if 1GB, and there are already 10 sandboxes that have reserved 100MB (either by default or by user-specification in the `max_memory` parameter) and an 11th process tries to reserve even more RAM, the server will NOT allocate that RAM
    - same format as `MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT`
    - default value is `1048576` or `1 GB`
    - public version of this API sets this to `1 GB`
- `ENABLE_DEBUG`: if true, the server will expose debug routes (like `/check-ram`) for monitoring and debugging purposes
    - this can only be set to `true` or `false`
    - by default this is `false`
    - the public API has this set to `true`
- `GIN_MODE`: whether to run the gin-gonic server in release mode or debug mode. For this API there won't be much of a performance difference regardless of which one you pick, and it is recommended that you read the docs for [gin-gonic](https://gin-gonic.com/en/docs/deployment/#configuration-options) for more information
    - this can be set to `release` or `debug`
    - by default it is set to `debug`
    - the public API has this set to `release`
- `PORT`: Which network port to run the server on
    - this can be set to any unsigned integer value between `0` and `65535`
    - by default this is `8080`
    - public API has this set to `8080`

**Note:** *if you are self-hosting this api, remember to run it with superuser permissions, or a user which has permissions to alter controlgroups and namespaces, normally you can achieve this just by using "sudo" before running the code*

<details>
<summary>Optional: Security Verification</summary>

This security verification suite is intended only for those users who want to self-host this API, the tests detailed below are for verifying if the sandboxing implemented by the codebase for running arbitrary user code is compatible with the host where the tests are running, run these commands on your host to verify that it's suitable for the kind of sandboxing I've implemented here. If one or more of these tests is failing then its probably a good idea to self-host this api inside of another more hardened container/VM. The host running the publically deployed version of this API is completely compatible with the sandboxing used in this codebase and is safe to use, but your host **might** not be.

#### Prerequisites

Run these safe checks on the host:

```bash
uname -a
test "$(uname -s)" = Linux
test -r /proc/self/status
test -e /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.controllers
test -e /proc/self/ns/user
test -e /proc/self/ns/pid
command -v gcc
command -v go
command -v python3
```

The integration suite also requires a writable cgroup v2 hierarchy, working user namespaces, and permission to create the required namespaces. Java tests additionally require `java` and `javac`. Check active mandatory access-control policy with the host's normal tools, for example `command -v getenforce && getenforce` for SELinux or `command -v aa-status && sudo aa-status` for AppArmor. A policy mismatch is an investigation item, not a reason to disable isolation.

#### Run the complete security suite

From the repository root, run:

```bash
sudo -E go test ./...
sudo -E go test -race ./executor
bash .github/scripts/check_regressions.sh
git diff --check
```

Run the repeated hostile boundary probe with:

```bash
sudo -E go test -count=3 -run '^TestSecurityBoundaryNamespacesAndInheritedResources$' ./...
sudo -E go test -count=3 -run '^TestSandboxHardeningC$/^hostile boundary attack chain cannot cross sandbox$' ./...
```

`sudo` is required because the test harness intentionally exercises privileged Linux isolation and cgroup operations. Never ignore a failed command, add `|| true`, or treat a skipped privileged test as success.

#### Sentinel-file verification

Use a disposable directory, never a real secret:

```bash
sentinel_dir=$(mktemp -d)
printf '%s\n' 'operator-sentinel-must-not-change' > "$sentinel_dir/sentinel"
sha256sum "$sentinel_dir/sentinel"
sudo -E go test -run '^TestSecurityBoundaryNamespacesAndInheritedResources$' ./...
sha256sum "$sentinel_dir/sentinel"
rm -rf "$sentinel_dir"
```

The adversarial workload attempts filesystem, descriptor, procfs, sysfs, IPC, UTS, socket, and temporary-path access. The host sentinel must still exist with the same checksum. Delete the disposable sentinel manually after verification.

#### Manual host-isolation checklist

Review the test output and host state after the suite. Confirm that host files are unreadable and unchanged, host processes cannot be enumerated or signalled, devices and mounts cannot be manipulated, `/sys` cannot be written, Unix sockets are not reachable, host environment secrets and file descriptors are absent, the configured network policy holds, sandbox descendants disappear after termination, and sandbox temporary resources do not remain on the host.

For cross-sandbox verification, run the repeated boundary probe while another terminal runs `sudo -E go test -count=10 -run '^TestSecurityBoundaryNamespacesAndInheritedResources$' ./...`. Neither run may report inherited descriptors, host process access, IPC visibility, host socket access, or host sentinel changes.

#### Failure interpretation

Missing cgroup v2 means resource enforcement cannot be established. Missing user namespaces or insufficient privileges means namespace isolation cannot be established. Missing compiler/runtime dependencies mean the relevant workload coverage did not execute. Unexpected mounts, devices, security-module state, namespace creation errors, or seccomp failures indicate a host or implementation mismatch. Do not disable the corresponding security mechanism as a workaround; investigate or move the service to a dedicated hardened Linux VM.

Generic GitHub-hosted runners cannot prove every kernel, LSM, device, mount-topology, cloud-metadata, or privileged-host-socket property. Those checks require a dedicated hardened VM with pinned kernel configuration and explicit network/device policy. See `SECURITY_TEST_MATRIX.md` for the boundary-by-boundary status and assumptions.
